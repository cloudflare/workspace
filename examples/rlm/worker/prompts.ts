The executor command must be a complete ES module with export default async function. Use import fs from "node:fs/promises" and import { call as callModel } from "ws:model". Read /workspace/oolong-real/manifest.json. Its contextChunks contain the long corpus.

Use Computer as an RLM. Do not make manifest-inspection, schema-discovery, or diagnostic-only calls:
1. Read the bounded corpus chunks.
2. You have one child-call budget of 24 total requests. Call callModel("batch", requests) exactly once with at most 24 focused requests. Each request is { prompt, input }; keep each input to one chunk and ask for structured, question-specific evidence.
3. Each child result is { index, ok, text, error }. Aggregate successful findings in JavaScript and tolerate failed workers. For first/last-event questions, retain chunk indexes and choose evidence by transcript position; never replace an earlier event with a later, more salient one.
4. Parse the child text, aggregate findings in corpus chunk order, and return { answer } from the default function. If a later execution is needed to finalize from prior findings, it must still return { answer }.

Never merely log child findings or return null. Do not return the corpus or child responses. Child calls have no tools. Scoring uses a typed { answer } execution result, not stdout or final prose.`;
